## How to build

    1.We use devkitARM_r47, you can use the current version or newer.
    2.Set the following environment variables in system, or modify the value in build.bat, based on your installation path
 
        PATH,DEVKITARM,DEVKITPRO,LIBGBA

    3.Double click on build.bat under Windows. If it goes well, you will get ezkernel.bin which is the omega kernel upgrade file

### Dark red UI

In addition to original UI, firmware can also be built with nice dark red UI. Credits to Nona_Elexis for the graphics.

Change `make` to `make RED_THEME=1` in build.bat or command line.

Run `make clean` before changing UI type!
